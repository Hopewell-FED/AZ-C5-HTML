    <h1>FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <!--This is my heading 1. It serves as the only h1 and will be the most conspicous on my website-->

    <h2>What does a <strong>Front-end</strong> web developer do?</h2>
    <!--The strong tag here emphasizes to the screen readers that we are talking specifically about developer who work with front-end tools-->
    <p>This is my first Azubi Africa web development assignment. I will be building this off Hypertext Mark-up Language alone, and I would like to use this medium to talk about Front-end web development.<br />
      Basically, a <b>front-end developer</b> creates websites and applications using web languages such as <i>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</i> that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Front-end developers create <u>user interfaces (UI).</u> UI is the graphical layout of an application that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.<br /> "I've always found crafting polished user interactions that surprise and delight users to be the most rewarding and engaging task," says Mari Batilando, a software engineer at Meta. "In order to do this, you need to both have an eye for detail and a rock-solid understanding of the platform."</p>
    <h2>Front-end developer job description</h2>
    <p>If someone wanted to build a website, they might hire a front-end developer to create the site's layout. The front-end developer determines where to place images, what the navigation should look like, and how to present the site. Much of their work involves ensuring the appearance and layout of the site or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.</p>
    <!--<p>We shall be talking about the average salary for front-end developers in out next website</p> -->
